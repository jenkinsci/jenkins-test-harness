/**
 * Marker for test methods which have been observed to fail for no easily understood reason.
 * They may be useful to keep in sources so developers and certain CI jobs can run them,
 * but failures should not block a validated merge build for example.
 * Only effective on {@link Test}-annotated (but not {@link WithoutJenkins}-annotated) methods in a class using {@link JenkinsRule}
 * when the system property {@code ignore.random.failures} is true.
 * @since 1.547
 * @deprecated Using a 2.x parent POM, Surefire will be configured to retry failing tests automatically. If the test fails consistently, {@link Ignore} it.
